# Input-Output Matrices, Algorithms, and Measuring Labor-Content 

The epistemological and scientific foundation of classical political economy was the “labor theory of value” (LTV). Perhaps a more fitting description is the “labor law of value.”

The LTV predicts that the prices of commodities vary proportionally with their labor-content. If a commodity contains “more labor” than another, then in all probability the first will have a higher price. The LTV makes substantial law-like claims and is not a moral proposition.

## Testing the LTV

Two major propositions to test the LTV: 

- 1. Commodity prices vary proportionally with their labor-content
- 2. Profit varies proportionally with surplus labor-content

The first can be construed as : 

- 1.1 For a "large enough" set of commodities, the market price of a commodity, will be positively correlated to labor-content.
- 1.2 For a "large enough" set of commodities, the labor-content vector will be a efficient predictor, or attractor of market price. 

The second can be :

We then need to measure labor-content. How can we operationalize these two statistical propositions such that we use *real data and its attributes* to *estimate* the labor-content of a set of commodities?
